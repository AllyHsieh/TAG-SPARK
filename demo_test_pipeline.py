"""
This file will help to demonstrate pipeline for testing microscopy data using the TAG-SPARK algorithm.
The demo shows how to construct the params and call the relevant functions for testing TAG-SPARK network.
The demo will automatically download tif file and corresponding model file for demo testing.
See inside for details.
